              I've been playing guitar since 2010 and, while not being the best at it, I occasionaly get some results that make me happy. I've only started singing recently, around October 2021, but I'm feeling quite confident. Not too much though.<br>
              My artist name is <b>bluehole.</b> and you can find me on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/blueholeproject">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/bluehole.">Spotify</a>.
              I've discovered to be a tone enthusiast during the years, but only from amp sims as I really don't have any space in my house <i>(my neighbours are also very happy)</i>. <br>
              Currently my rig is:<br>
              <li>
                <b>Fender Jaguar American 60s</b> - my favorite guitar, my go-to whenever I wanna randomly play or try to write something new. Its sound is fantastic and everything is stock, from tuning keys to pickups - apart from the bridge which is a StayTrem 9,5" bridge and I love it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>PRS SE Custom 24</b> - with an unique colorway called "Poplar Burl Green" (I think) that's my second favorite. I mostly use that for metal, but with splitcoils you can do pretty much anything and that's the very best part of it! 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Jackson HT7 Pro</b> - the Misha Mansoor cheap signature, just to get that djenty 0000s I really need in my life. Used mostly for modern metal, I really dig it as it's light and sounds great for a price that doesn't break the bank. Not a shredder tho, only syncopated riffs and 0s.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>SubZero Rogue VI</b> - heavily influenced by Loathe, I bought it as it's a cheaper Fender Bass VI but with humbuckers and it honestly sounds nice! Not the best axe but definitely a good and fun one.
              </li>

              On December 2021 I've reached out to Jason Maas as he was giving one-on-one mentoring mixing courses, so we spoke a bit and I started this journey with him, lasted about six months. In this time I've learned new things and developed my previous amateur skills, I can't thank him enough for this. I've then re-mixed some of my covers and release new things, like these ones:<br>

              If you're interested in anything like that and you want me to mix your things, drop me an email to <b>sergio.bianchini@live.it</b>!
